# Three dee canvas

This is a demo project to combine my trade ( Ruby on Rails ) with a personal intrest ( Open/WebGL )

The end goal is to have an application where you can place objects in space and save it as a "Canvas" ( Lacking a better word )

##Development Goals:

  * <del>Create Staple WebApp using Zurb Foundation and Rails</del>

  * <del>Create Database storing Transformation matrices and other object properties</del>

  * <del>Create REST API for javascript frontend to interact with the backend</del>

  * <del>Add WebGL program I created earlier</del>
    * Fix UI Bug whereby the user has to manually select the first created object in order to interact with it
    * Fix Missing Triangle on Cube
    * Remove AngularJS dependency

  * Edit WebGL program to interact with the REST API to
    * Submit State
    * Fetch State

##Possibly
	
	* Move to TypeScript
