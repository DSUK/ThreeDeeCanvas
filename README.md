# Three dee canvas

This is a demo project to combine my trade ( Ruby on Rails ) with a personal intrest ( Open/WebGL )

The end goal is to have an application where you can place objects in space and save it as a "Canvas" ( Lacking a better word )

##Development Goals:

	* ~~Create Staple WebApp using Zurb Foundation and Rails~~

	* ~~Create Database storing Transformation matrices and other object properties~~

	* Create REST API for javascript frontend to interact with the backend

	* ~~Add WebGL program I created earlier~~
	  * Fix UI Bug whereby the user has to manually select the first created object in order to interact with it
	  * Remove AngularJS dependency

	* Edit WebGL program to interact with the REST API to
		* Submit State
		* Fetch State

##Possibly
	
	* Move to TypeScript
